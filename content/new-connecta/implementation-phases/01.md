## Step by step:

1. Develop the Orchestrator for NewConnecta.
2. Provide a frontend API interface through NewConnecta's Orchestrator.
3. Enable the UC to manage its configurations via its dedicated API.
4. Integrate the UC API service within NewConnecta's Orchestrator and relay it to the frontend API.
5. Design a comprehensive set of frontend components to manage the configurations of the UC service.
6. Implement the necessary architectural framework to oversee the entire workflow.

## Section details

### Step 1: Develop the Orchestrator for NewConnecta.

A brand new project, along with its entire data model & database, to represent the entity of the new orchestrator.

This entity or application will soon be responsible for managing newly created recipes. Moreover, during the initial phase, it will be responsible of the relaying of the workers API's to the front-end.

It will utilize its local database, for which a data model has been developed and can be accessed at the provided reference, [here](../classmap.md) ('Orchestration' section)

- Determine frontend and uServices frontend strategies:
  - MicroFrontend & Lazy Loadings
  - MonoRepo & Nx?
