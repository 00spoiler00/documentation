# Worker

## Roles

- Receive messages from the RabbitMq queues. Messages will contain **blobId & profileId**
- Perform the _recipe_step_ or _cook_step_ **work**, converting a payload into a new one/s based on messages
- Use a the profile/setup concept to allow each implementation to have it's own configuration
- Use a local storage to store the profiles
- Expose the configuration profiles in the local storage via a **setup API** the provides CRUD operations for them
- Have a common databases for each WorkerType cluster.

## Legacy workers

As a legacy worker, the workflow may be defined in the worker itself (instead of using the new recipes).

As part of the migration process, chunks of functionality may be gradually extracted from legacy workers into regular ones.

In the event that this functionality has been extracted, Legacy workers may implement an **interface** that allows for flow control and the execution of these extracted functionalities using the new orchestration ecosystem, initiated directly from the converter. To achieve this, the interface should allow for the storage of the payload in the blob for processing, initiate a task in the orchestrator, identifying it as a single-step flow, and await its synchronous result in order to proceed with the natural sequential processing typical of these types of Legacy workers.

### Interface for **ùëìn** extraction

This interface must allow to:

- Store the payload for processing
- Syncronously launch the task into the orchestrator API
- Await the result

### Trait

- InteractsWithStorage (InteractsWithBlob)
- InteractsWithStorage (InteractsWithFS)
- SubscribesToMq
