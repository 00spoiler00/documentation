This section is my personal kitchen where I whip up all the ideas simmering from market inputs, colleague insights, or those sleepless night specials!

## Connexionist AI

### NLPs

- RAG: "Retreival Augmented Generation": RAG is an AI framework for retrieving facts from an external knowledge base to ground large language models (LLMs) on the most accurate, up-to-date information and to give users insight into LLMs' generative process. [more info](https://research.ibm.com/blog/retrieval-augmented-generation-RAG)

#### Assistant GPTs (Tailored AI-driven advisory services)

- **UVE Comercial Assistant**: Leveraging your company's current comercial data to enhance UVE service introduction to client searching for solutions. ✅ [DEMO](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-vTxa55icX-uve-route-to-market-expert)
- **GPTs Customer support Assitant**: Trained with the developer portal knowledge (to be improved), could perform a first level support attendance, _minimizing time/geographic company growth impact_. ⛏️
- **GPTs Customer Consultant Assistant**: Leveraging your company's unique data to enhance client strategies and decision-making. ⛏️ [PEP]
- **GPTs Internal strategist Assitant**: Brainwave oriented GPTs, trained with company & market context, educated for business strategic proposals based on input and realtime status. ⛏️
- **GPTs Internal support Assitant**: Trained with the internal [documentation portal] ⛏️(#other-general-raw-concepts-or-improvements), could provide a fast and confiable response to UVE task, procedures, etc, to any internal worker. ⛏️

\*All the assistants are subject to grat improvements via acitins ⛏️

#### As an interface

- Improve street user efficiency and customer perception using form auto filling via voice input: Use whishper + NLP to translate into a prefilled form. (Assisted)
- As a supporting scaffolding tool fro 'potentials' custom projects. Now they are completely manual?

#### Data interpretations

- Use of DataAnalysis GPTs in existing dashboards to extract insights
- As a suggester for UveClient to suggest data extraction queries ✅ [DEMO](https://chat.openai.com/g/g-r1tVZp7tK-uve-client-query-composer/c/70a1f094-4b4f-4b02-a4e8-ed69f46b294a)

### Predictive & Interpretation

Areas where a predictive or data visualization (refer to [strategy](#strategy-concepts)) system could provide differential value.

#### Route optimiztion (sell better!)

- Street planned visits (From cloud or even in street): Improved performance. Based on suggestion. Feeds itself from real agent gps track.
- Delivery routes for distributors. Improved costs & performance. Desification. (do feedback to street delivery dates based on load, availability, etc..)

#### Data acquisition for future implementations

- Track and store street instances routes: Route optimization data to feed algos.
- Street as an input for images and Image Recognition classifications (CLIP tagging)

#### Prediction

- Impreove the multichannel experience, generating DevelotoTraAlgo per millora multicanal. (3 sortides canal , multi input, entrada sequecial, transformers)

- Analytics are also in the process:

  - PowerBI, Tableau, [Preset - OPEN!](https://preset.io/), [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/dashboards/)

#### Future

Provide differentiation by adding visibility and readability to complex data promoting a tandem between human and machine provided solutions and thus avoiding black-box solutions.
**Review [graphex](https://app.graphext.com/projects/UHJvamVjdC03MzA1Mg==/v/data) use case.** victoriano@graphext.com

- Clustering for data interpretations
- Allow experts from domain to read complexity.
- Validate predictive techniques, being supervised by human domain knowledge.

### New target potential customers for RTM

- Route to Market for software producers. (Very commonly, I am hearing about software industry requiring a partner structure to solve their lack of commercial and implantation networks.

## Culture and team

- Should we enforce GPT in the team? You have to be trained to it!

## Other general RAW concepts or improvements

- Create an internal documentation platform, will feed the assistant.
- Use CLIP to extract tagging from images obtained via street
- Reverse ETL (as the product of actionable data) sipOut on steroids :)
- New .NET 8 and Aspire to manage multi part applications (Orchestrastor & nodes, etc...)
- GPTs Embeddings. [Test]
- Review on matching procedure: Flow is string -> location -> string. This relays on invested providers string2loc algos. Returning string is basically inferred from location area pertenences. So, precedents is to improve location resolving and match against it.
- Add gzip, deflate to all API responses. (Africa)
