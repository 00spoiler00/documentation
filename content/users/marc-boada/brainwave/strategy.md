| --------------- | ------------------------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Pre-2000        | Data pipelines? Definitely an IT problem.        | In-house solution development                                                | Managing a small number of data integration pipelines          |
| 2000 to 2010    | Social networks usher in a rebirth of data.      | Handling increased data volume                                               | Emergence of tools like Hadoop for computational workloads     |
| 2010 to 2015    | The advent of cloud computing and ETL solutions. | Explosion of cloud tools and SaaS solutions                                  | Rise of data analysts with unified data views                  |
| 2015 to 2020    | The rise of modern cloud data warehouses and ELT | Emergence of modern cloud data warehouses like BigQuery, Redshift, Snowflake | Shift to ELT promoting agile decision-making and data literacy |
| 2020 to 2021    | The rise of dbt and the analytics engineer       | Emergence of dbt as a data transformation standard                           | The role of analytics engineer becomes prominent               |
| 2021 and beyond | Data integration in 2021 and beyond              | Addressing challenges in integrations and security                           | Focusing on cost efficiency in data operations                 |

### Present

- ETL beacoming a **commodity**:

  - [Fivetran](https://www.fivetran.com/)
  - [Stitch](https://www.stitchdata.com/)
  - [Rivery.io](https://rivery.io/)
  - [AirByte - OPEN!](https://airbyte.com/)
  - [AirFlow - OPEN!](https://airflow.apache.org)

  - [DBT](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-core) Trendy for **'Transform'** fase:

- Analytics are also in the process:

  - PowerBI, Tableau, [Preset - OPEN!](https://preset.io/), [Metabase](https://www.metabase.com/dashboards/)

### Future

Provide differentiation by adding visibility and readability to complex data promoting a tandem between human and machine provided solutions and thus avoiding black-box solutions.
**Review [graphex](https://app.graphext.com/projects/UHJvamVjdC03MzA1Mg==/v/data) use case.** victoriano@graphext.com

- Clustering for data interpretations
- Allow experts from domain to read complexity.
- Validate predictive techniques, being supervised by human domain knowledge.

## New target potential customers for RTM

- Route to Market for software producers. (Very commonly, I am hearing about software industry requiring a partner structure to solve their lack of commercial and implantation networks.

## Other general RAW concepts or improvements

- Create an internal documentation platform, will feed the assistant.
- Use CLIP to extract tagging from images obtained via street
- Reverse ETL (as the product of actionable data) sipOut on steroids :)
- New .NET 8 and Aspire to manage multi part applications (Orchestrastor & nodes, etc...)
- GPTs Embeddings. [Test]
- Review on matching procedure: Flow is string -> location -> string. This relays on invested providers string2loc algos. Returning string is basically inferred from location area pertenences. So, precedents is to improve location resolving and match against it.
- Add gzip, deflate to all API responses. (Africa)
